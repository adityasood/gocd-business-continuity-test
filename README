This is a docker-compose recipe to use for testing GoCD's Business Continuity add-on.

Steps
=====

1. Build a gocd-server Docker image with the commit you need and call it `gocd-server-for-bc-test`. Maybe that's the
   latest commit. Maybe it's an older build that is a release candidate. Something like this:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gocd/gocd-docker.git
   cd gocd-docker
   docker build -f Dockerfile.gocd-server -t gocd-server-for-bc-test .
   ```

   If you want to try with an existing docker image you have, you can use `docker tag` to tag that image with the name
   `gocd-server-for-bc-test`.


2. Put the Postgres and Business Continuity add-ons you want to test into `dependencies/addons` directory.

3. Run: `docker-compose up`
